# # Track Machine Learning experiments and models
# 
# A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data. Once you have trained the model, you can use it to reason over data that it hasn't seen before, and make predictions about that data.
# 
# In this notebook, you will learn the basic steps to run an experiment, add a model version to track run metrics and parameters and register a model.
